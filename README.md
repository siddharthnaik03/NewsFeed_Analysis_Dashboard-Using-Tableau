# NewsFeed_Analysis_Dashboard-Using-Tableau
## Objective

My main goal is to generate graphs that analyze users’ interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service. For this purpose, I craft a data visualization in Tableau that captures critical findings from 01–01–2023 to 05–31–2023. Build Tableau dashboard from scratch.

The aim of this Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau project is to determine which type resonates more with our audience and identify potential issues with these features, along with suggestions for enhancements. The task is to create several visualizations giving crucial information about the newsfeed and how the users react to it.

## Data source
The data used in these project was sourced from a comprehensive study involving 365 Data Science Platforms.

## Visualization
For Newsfeed Dashboard Analysis, I created different chart for better display findings and communicate analysis.


## Insights
In my project, I incorporated a dynamic newsfeed dashboard featuring:


**Monthly Post Activity and Average Likes**
Display a dual-axis bar chart and line chart, illustrating monthly post activity and average likes. Examining monthly post activity and average likes provides valuable insights into user engagement patterns. In January, the platform witnessed 8,665 posts with an average of 0.10 likes per posts. February had 7,235 posts with an average of 0.09 likes per post, while March had the highest post activity at 17,933 posts with a lower average like count of 0.04 , April saw 5,838 posts with a higher average like count of 0.11, and May recorded 8,540 posts with an average of 0.09 likes. This insight reveals fluctuations in both posts volume and user appreciation, offering a nuanced understanding of monthly user engagement dynamics.

**Subtype Post Distribution**
Presents a horizontal bar chart illustrating the distribution of post subtypes. The distribution of post subtypes offers a nuanced view of user activity. Level post lead with 22,313 posts, closely followed by Course Certificates at 11,199 posts, Collection with 9,376 posts, Streaks with 3,413 posts, and Goals with 1,616 posts, contribute significantly, while Text post with 150 posts and Career track certificates post with 144 posts. This insight sheds light on the content landscape within the platform, showcasing user engagement across various post subtypes.

Employs a pie chart to depict subtype popularity measured by comments. Analyzing post subtype popularity based on comments unveils distinctive user interactions. Text post lead with 102 comments, followed by Level post with 31 comments and Course Certificates post with 21 comments. Career track certificate post with and Streaks post generate engagement with 18 and 10 comments, Goals post and Collections post receive 3 comments each. This insights not only quantifies user interactions but also highlights the varying degrees of engagement across different post subtypes on the platform.
